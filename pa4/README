In this assignment I built a Graph module in C that implements the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

For example, the input file will display a group of pairs for the graph which will
be used to perforem DFS.
example:
9
1 2
2 1
2 3
3 5
5 4
4 3
5 6
6 8
7 6
8 7
8 9
1 3
1 4
1 5
1 6
1 7
1 8
1 9
2 4
2 5
2 6
2 7

5 9
6 9
7 9
9 9
0 0

output:
Adjacency list representation of G:
1: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2: 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
3: 5 6 7 8 9
4: 3 6 7 8 9
5: 4 6 7 8 9
6: 8 9
7: 6 9
8: 7 9
9: 9

G contains 4 strongly connected components:
Component 1: 1 2
Component 2: 3 4 5
Component 3: 6 7 8
Component 4: 9

The output gives the adjacent list and the strongly connected components involved.
