In this programming assignment we used an Integer ADT to perform Breadth First Searches in terms of a graph.

Systematically we were supposed explore the edges of the points on a graph and find every vertex reachable.

Example, if input is

15
1 7
2 3
2 6
3 7
4 10
5 9
5 10
6 7
6 11
7 12
8 13
9 13
9 14
10 15
14 15
0 0
1 12
1 15
4 8
9 6
15 8
0 0 

The output would perform BFS and produce,

1: 7
2: 3 6
3: 2 7
4: 10
5: 9 10
6: 2 7 11
7: 1 3 6 12
8: 13
9: 5 13 14
10: 4 5 15
11: 6
12: 7
13: 8 9
14: 9 15
15: 10 14

The distance from 1 to 12 is 2
A shortest 1-12 path is: 1 7 12

The distance from 1 to 15 is infinity
No 1-15 path exists

The distance from 4 to 8 is 5
A shortest 4-8 path is: 4 10 5 9 13 8

The distance from 9 to 6 is infinity
No 9-6 path exists

The distance from 15 to 8 is 4
A shortest 15-8 path is: 15 14 9 13 8
