In pa2, we were supposed to implement the BigInteger ADT which took a big integer and either added subtracted or multiplied for an answer. 

For example, if the input was
10
-0041085449
10
7402779357

the output would be

-41085449

7402779357

7361693908

-7443864806

0

-14928815061

-304146513730276293

1688014119531601

54801142208425333449

355708308072979699484782930346148190803050903225721

This can be seen by testing all of the BigInteger functions and queues
